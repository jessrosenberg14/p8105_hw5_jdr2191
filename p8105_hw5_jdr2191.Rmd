## Problem 1

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na == c("", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state),
         resolution = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
         )) %>%
  relocate(city_state) %>%
  filter(city_state != "TulsaAL")

homicide_df %>%
  count(city_state) %>% view

```

victim_age: encoded as a character (will want to address)
some other things are listed as NA

The homicide dataset contains `r count(homicide_data)` observations.

```{r}
homicides = 
homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", " , state)) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>%
  summarise(number_homicides = n_distinct(uid))

unique(pull(homicides, disposition))
```


## Problem 2

```{r}
allfiles_df = 
  list.files(path = "data", pattern = "*.csv")



view(allfiles_df)
```
